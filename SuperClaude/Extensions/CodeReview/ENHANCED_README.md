cd SuperClaude/Extensions/CodeReview
python setup_enhanced_system.py
```

### 2. Configure Claude API (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Set your Claude API key for real AI analysis
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key_here"

# Test the enhanced system
python setup_enhanced_system.py
```

### 3. Run Enhanced Code Review

```python
import asyncio
from SuperClaude.Extensions.CodeReview import get_all_agents, AgentCoordinator

async def enhanced_review():
    # Get specialized agents
    agents = get_all_agents()
    
    # Create enhanced coordinator with project context
    project_context = {
        'priority': 'security',  # security, performance, maintainability, balanced
        'security_sensitive': True,
        'performance_critical': False
    }
    coordinator = AgentCoordinator(agents, project_context)
    
    # Your code to review
    code = """
    def process_user_input(user_data):
        # Example with intentional issues
        query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_data['id']}"  # SQL injection!
        return database.execute(query)
    """
    
    # Run enhanced analysis
    results = await coordinator.run_comprehensive_review(code, "python")
    
    # Enhanced results include:
    print(f"Suggestions: {results['summary']['total_suggestions']}")
    print(f"Conflicts detected: {results['summary']['conflicts_detected']}")
    print(f"Conflicts resolved: {results['summary']['conflicts_resolved']}")
    print(f"Synergies found: {results['summary']['synergies_found']}")
    print(f"Collaboration score: {results['summary']['collaboration_score']}/100")
    
    # Review focus areas
    for area in results['focus_areas']:

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Agent Example

With real Claude integration, the Security Agent now provides:

```python
# Example enhanced security analysis
{
    "principle": "SQL Injection Prevention",
    "line_number": 3,
    "original_code": "query = f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}\"",
    "suggested_code": "query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s\"\nresult = cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))",
    "reasoning": "String formatting in SQL queries enables SQL injection attacks",
    "educational_explanation": "SQL injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities (OWASP #1). When user input is directly inserted into SQL queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code. This could allow them to access unauthorized data, modify records, or even execute system commands. Always use parameterized queries which separate SQL logic from user data, making injection impossible.",
    "impact_score": 9.5,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "severity": "critical",
    "category": "injection"
}
```

## ü§ù Collaboration Engine Example

When Performance and Security agents conflict:

```python
# Example conflict resolution
{
    "conflict_type": "philosophical",
    "description": "Performance vs Security trade-off detected",
    "involved_agents": ["Performance Agent", "Security Agent"],
    "resolution_strategy": "context_driven",
    "resolved_suggestion": {
        "principle": "Secure Performance Optimization",
        "reasoning": "Implement caching with input validation to achieve both security and performance goals",
        "resolution_rationale": "Resolved based on project priority: security-sensitive application prioritizes security while maintaining performance through secure caching patterns"
    }
}
```

## üìä Enhanced Output Features

    },
    "conflicts": [...],  # Resolved conflicts with rationale
    "synergies": [...],  # Synergistic suggestions
    "priority_matrix": {...},  # Agent priority scores
