### Week 2: CrewAI
**Discovery Questions:**
- "How do you organize multiple agents to work together?"
- "What happens when agents have different roles and specializations?"
- "How do you prevent agents from working at cross-purposes?"

### Week 3: LangGraph
**Framework Understanding:**
- "How do you create complex workflows with decision points?"
- "What's the difference between sequential and conditional agent flows?"
- "How do you handle error recovery in agent pipelines?"

### Week 4: AutoGen
**Multi-Agent Dynamics:**
- "How do agents negotiate and reach consensus?"
- "What happens when agents disagree on the solution?"
- "How do you design agent conversations that stay productive?"

### Week 5: MCP (Multi-Agent Coordination Platform)
**Coordination Exploration:**
- "How do you coordinate agents across different systems?"
- "What protocols are needed for agent-to-agent communication?"
- "How do you scale from 2 agents to 10 agents to 100?"

### Week 6: Integration & Projects
**Practical Application:**
- "Which framework fits your specific use case?"
- "How do you combine multiple frameworks effectively?"
- "What are the cost implications of your agent design?"

## Framework Comparison Discovery

### OpenAI vs CrewAI
**Comparative Questions:**
- "When would you choose simplicity over collaboration?"
- "What's the trade-off between control and autonomy?"
- "How do licensing and cost models affect your choice?"

### LangGraph vs AutoGen
**Workflow vs Conversation:**
- "Do you need structured workflows or flexible conversations?"
- "How important is visual representation of agent flows?"
- "What debugging capabilities does each framework provide?"

### Cost-Conscious Exploration
**Economic Decision Making:**
- "How do you balance capability with API costs?"
- "When should you consider local models like Ollama?"
- "What's the total cost of ownership for agent systems?"
