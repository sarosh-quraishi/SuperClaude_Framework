# /clean_code - Clean Code Analysis

## Purpose
Apply Robert C. Martin's Clean Code principles to analyze code for meaningful names, small functions, single responsibility, and readability improvements.

## Usage
```
/clean_code [file_path|code_block] [--format text|json] [--severity all|high|critical] [--examples]
```

## Arguments
- `file_path` - Path to file to analyze (if not provided, analyzes current context)
- `code_block` - Inline code to analyze (wrap in triple backticks)
- `--format` - Output format (text for human-readable, json for structured data)
- `--severity` - Filter suggestions by severity level
- `--examples` - Include before/after code examples in output

## Educational Focus Areas

### Core Clean Code Principles
1. **Meaningful Names** - Variables, functions, and classes should reveal intention
2. **Small Functions** - Functions should be small and do one thing well
3. **Single Responsibility** - Each function/class should have one reason to change
4. **DRY Principle** - Don't repeat yourself, eliminate code duplication
5. **Comments** - Code should be self-documenting, comments explain WHY not WHAT
6. **Error Handling** - Proper exception handling, no ignored errors
7. **Function Parameters** - Minimize parameters, avoid flag arguments
8. **Code Structure** - Clear organization, proper formatting, logical flow

## Execution Process

### 1. Code Analysis
- Load and parse the target code
- Apply Clean Code agent analysis
- Identify violations of Clean Code principles
- Generate educational suggestions with examples

### 2. Educational Output
For each suggestion, provide:
- **Principle Applied**: Which Clean Code rule is being violated
- **Current Issue**: What makes the current code problematic
- **Educational Explanation**: Why this principle matters for maintainability
- **Suggested Improvement**: Concrete example of better approach
- **Impact Assessment**: How this change improves code quality

### 3. Implementation Guidance
- Prioritize suggestions by impact on code maintainability
- Provide specific refactoring steps
- Include code examples showing before/after
- Explain long-term benefits of applying the principle

## Example Output Format

```
üßπ Clean Code Analysis Results

üìç Line 15: Variable Naming Issue
‚ùå Current: temp_data = process(input)
‚úÖ Suggested: processed_user_profile = process(user_input)

üí° Clean Code Principle: Meaningful Names
üìö Why This Matters: Generic names like 'temp_data' don't reveal intention. 
    Readers must examine surrounding code to understand what the variable contains.
    Meaningful names make code self-documenting and easier to maintain.

üéØ Impact: Medium (Improves code readability and maintainability)
üìä Confidence: 85%

---

üìç Lines 23-45: Function Length Issue
‚ùå Current: process_user_data_and_send_notification() [23 lines]
‚úÖ Suggested: Break into smaller functions:
    - validate_user_data()
    - save_user_profile()  
    - send_welcome_notification()

üí° Clean Code Principle: Small Functions
üìö Why This Matters: Large functions violate Single Responsibility Principle.
    They're harder to understand, test, and reuse. Small functions with
    descriptive names serve as documentation and are easier to maintain.

üéØ Impact: High (Significantly improves testability and maintainability)
üìä Confidence: 90%
```

## Learning Outcomes

After using `/clean_code`, developers will understand:
- How to write intention-revealing names
- When and how to break down large functions
- How to eliminate code duplication effectively
- Why comments should explain intent, not implementation
- How Clean Code principles improve long-term maintainability

- `/code_review` - Comprehensive multi-agent analysis including Clean Code
- `/improve --quality` - General quality improvements
- `/refactor` - Systematic code restructuring
- `/document` - Generate documentation for cleaned code
